# 100-days-of-code
This repository chronicles my journey of coding every day for 100 days as part of my college assignment. It’s intended to help me build consistency, improve my problem‑solving skills, and deepen my understanding of programming.

## 📌 Objective

Code daily for 100 consecutive days.

Explore and learn key programming concepts, data structures, algorithms.

Solve problems, build mini‑projects, and track progress.

Reflect on growth in logic, syntax, debugging, and code structuring.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

Language: C (the repository contains only C files so far) 

Editor: VS Code 

Version control: Git & GitHub

## 📅 Progress Structure

Each day is numbered and corresponds to an individual problem or exercise. 

- Execution:

Each file is self-contained and can be compiled/executed independently.

Example for compiling C code:

## gcc Day001_Problem1.c -o Day001_Problem1
## ./Day001_Problem1

In this repository the files follow naming conventions like 590024460-princy-01-Q1.c, etc.

## 🔹 Topics Covered

Basic syntax, variables,loops

Functions, recursion

Arrays, pointers 

Problem solving (pattern printing etc)

File handling 

And other programming fundamentals

## ✅ What I’ve Achieved So Far

Started coding daily and committing changes to GitHub.

Completed [96] days of the challenge.

Gained better comfort with C programming and improved debugging proficiency.

## 📌 Notes & Conventions

Each code file is intended to be self‑contained and readable (with comments where necessary).
