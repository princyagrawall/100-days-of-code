# 100-days-of-code

This repository documents my 100-day coding journey undertaken as part of a college assignment. It reflects my commitment to developing consistent coding habits, strengthening problem-solving abilities, and deepening my understanding of core programming concepts.

## 📌 Objective

Code daily for 100 consecutive days.

Explore and learn key programming concepts, data structures, algorithms.

Solve problems and track progress.

Reflect on growth in logic, syntax, debugging, and code structuring.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

Language: C (the repository contains only C files so far) 

Editor: VS Code

Version control: Git & GitHub

## 📅 Progress Structure

Each day is numbered and corresponds to an individual problem or exercise. 

- Execution:

Each file is self-contained and can be compiled independently.

Example for compiling C code:

## gcc 590024460-princy-01-Q1.c -o 590024460-princy-01-Q1
## ./590024460-princy-01-Q1

In this repository the files follow naming conventions like 590024460-princy-01-Q1.c, etc.

## 🔹 Topics Covered

Basic syntax, variables,loops

Functions, recursion

Arrays, pointers 

Problem solving (pattern printing etc)

File handling 

And other programming fundamentals

## ✅ What I’ve Achieved So Far

Started coding daily and committing changes to GitHub.

Completed 99 days of the challenge.

Gained better comfort with C programming and improved debugging proficiency.

## 📌 Notes & Conventions

Each code file is intended to be self‑contained and readable (with comments where necessary).
